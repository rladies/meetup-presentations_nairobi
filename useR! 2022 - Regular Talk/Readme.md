### Abstract of the talk:

R-Ladies Nairobi was started in May 2020, two months after the first COVID-19 case was announced in Kenya. Since then, the chapter has grown to 1000+ members.

How did we do it? During 2019 - 2020, four ladies (i.e., Faith, Njoki, Maggie and Shel) each had an intention of starting an R-Ladies Nairobi meetup chapter. One of us had recently been an R-Ladies curator and another had attended the useR! 2019 conference, where they met other amazing R-Ladies. After several discussions among ourselves, the chapter was launched.

In this talk, we’ll highlight a few things, including (i) the steps we took to officially launch the chapter, (ii) the activities we’ve had so far (including collaborations with other communities), (iii) how we source for speakers, (iv) our social media presence, (v) how we ensure the success of the meetups, (vi) what motivates us, (vii) our latest achievements, and lastly our future plans.
