Abstract of the talk: Abstract of the talk: During April 2022, I participated in the #30DayChartChallenge - a data visualisation challenge where participants create a new chart each day based on the daily prompt. In this talk, I'll discuss why and how I created 30 charts, the aspects I found most challenging, and some interesting things I discovered in R along the way!
